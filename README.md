# YOLOv2-Car-Object-Detection
Using Tensorflow and Keras, implemented object detection using YOLO v2 model architecture for front car cameras.
**Note: The variables.data file for the pre-trained model are too big to upload to GitHub**

## Objectives
- Detect objects in a car detection dataset
- Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
- Implement intersection over union
- Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning

### Results
- Using a pre-trained model, it returns 80 classes of bounding boxes for objects detected from a front camera.
